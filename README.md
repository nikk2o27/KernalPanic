Hello, I'm new to coding and currently studying HTML. The main reason is I'd like to make a tribute page for my grandfather who passed away 2 years ago.
I want to constantly update and uprade that tribute page and share with my entire family so they can always have access to great memories of my grandfather
and so they can continue to see me ever evolving in the wonderful world of coding and programming. Cheers!
